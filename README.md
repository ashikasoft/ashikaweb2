# ashikasoft dictionary

A small Japanese - English dictionary.

This application uses dictionary data from various sources -- see the LICENSE file.

There is some history to this application -- initially a java class, it was first deployed as an app in the Android Play store.

Subsequently, it was included as part of a trial web application in Scala, hosted on AWS.

It was then ported to Clojure, superseding the Scala app on the same AWS site.

Finally, it forked into 2 branches:
* a Clojurescript branch, so that all dependencies are statically hosted on Github pages.
* a slimmed-down version of the Clojure branch, which runs on a regular host (Heroku)

## Development

This uses a build tool called [Leiningen][1].

The dictionary files need to be massaged into indexes, to be easily accessible as static resources.
The script to do this will be included, hopefully soon.


## Deployment

Create an uberjar with

    lein uberjar
